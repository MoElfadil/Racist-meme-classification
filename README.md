# Racist-meme-classification

This repository includes the code required to replicate the results in the "Automatic detection of racist content in memes" paper. The results can be replicated by running the notebook files. This code also requires access to my img and survey responses folder. I am happy to share this over email which is mohammed.elfadil17@imperial.ac.uk.
